# Story 1.1: Python Project Scaffolding

**Status:** Approved

**Story**
**As a** developer,
**I want** the Python backend project to be scaffolded with `uv` for environment management and `ruff` and `pytest` for quality tooling,
**so that** I have a modern, standardized foundation for development.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. The `backend` directory is configured as a `uv` project.
2. A `pyproject.toml` file in the `backend` directory is configured with the initial project dependencies: `fastapi` and `uvicorn`.
3. The `pyproject.toml` also includes development dependencies: `pytest` for testing and `ruff` for linting.
4. A `uv` virtual environment can be successfully created and activated from within the `backend` directory.
5. The existing `.gitignore` file is updated to exclude the `.venv` directory.

**Tasks / Subtasks**
- [ ] Initialize `uv` in the `backend` directory. (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create and configure `backend/pyproject.toml`. (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Add `fastapi` and `uvicorn` to dependencies.
  - [ ] Add `pytest` and `ruff` to dev-dependencies.
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` to include `.venv`. (AC: 5)
- [ ] Document environment setup steps in `backend/README.md`. (AC: 4)

**Dev Notes**
- **Technology Stack**: [Source: docs/architecture/3-technology-stack.md]
  - Python 3.13
  - `uv` for package management.
  - `fastapi` for the web framework.
  - `ruff` for linting and formatting.
  - `pytest` for testing.
- **Directory Structure**: [Source: docs/architecture/8-directory-structure.md]
  - All backend code resides in the `/backend` directory.
  - The `pyproject.toml` should be at the root of the `/backend` directory.
- **Coding Standards**: [Source: docs/architecture/4-coding-standards.md]
  - Code must be PEP 8 compliant, enforced by `ruff`.
  - Type hinting is mandatory.

**Testing**
- **Testing Strategy**: [Source: docs/architecture/10-testing-strategy.md]
  - Unit tests will be implemented using `pytest`.
  - For this story, testing will focus on ensuring the project structure and dependencies are correctly configured. A simple "hello world" test for `pytest` would be sufficient to validate the setup.
