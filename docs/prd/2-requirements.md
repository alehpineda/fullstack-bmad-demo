# 2. Requirements

## 2.1. Functional

*   **FR1:** The backend shall provide an API endpoint to fetch a single Pokémon's data (ID, name, sprite URL) from the database using its unique ID.
*   **FR2:** A data synchronization script shall populate the local SQLite database with data for the **first 151 Pokémon** (ID, name, and sprite URL) from the public Pokémon API.
*   **FR3:** The frontend shall display a single page containing a search input field that accepts a Pokémon ID.
*   **FR4:** Upon entering a valid Pokémon ID and initiating a search, the frontend shall display the corresponding Pokémon's ID, name, and sprite image.
*   **FR5:** If a search is initiated for a Pokémon ID that does not exist in the database, the frontend shall display a clear "Pokémon not found" message.

## 2.2. Non-Functional

*   **NFR1:** The application must be a responsive web application, accessible on modern desktop and mobile browsers.
*   **NFR2:** API response times for fetching Pokémon data should be under 200ms for a responsive user experience.
*   **NFR3:** The entire application (frontend, backend, data-sync script) must be fully containerized using Docker for easy, one-command startup.
*   **NFR4:** The project will use a monorepo to house all source code.
*   **NFR5:** The technology stack is fixed to Python/FastAPI for the backend, SQLite for the database, and HTMX/Tailwind CSS for the frontend.
*   **NFR6:** The project must adhere to a $0 budget, utilizing only open-source tools or services with free tiers.
*   **NFR7:** The development workflow must follow the BMAD method, including the use of AI agents for story implementation and pull request generation.
