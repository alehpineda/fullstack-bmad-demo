# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1. Goals

*   Secure a "go" decision from team leadership to pilot the BMAD method on a future, real-world project.
*   Create a definitive, reusable training asset for onboarding team members to AI-assisted development practices.
*   Measurably increase the team's confidence and reduce skepticism about adopting AI-driven development workflows.
*   Demonstrate a significantly faster development time for the MVP compared to traditional methods.
*   Ensure AI-generated code and documentation are rated as high-quality and maintainable by the team.
*   Deliver a fully functional and deployed Pokedex application via Docker.
*   Allow a user to successfully search for a Pok√©mon by its ID and see the correct name and sprite displayed.

## 1.2. Background Context

The primary challenge this project addresses is the difficulty for our internal teams to fully grasp the practical benefits of the BMAD method from abstract documentation alone. This creates skepticism and slows the adoption of new AI-assisted development paradigms.

This project will serve as a tangible, end-to-end case study to overcome this hesitancy. By building a Pokedex application from scratch using the BMAD method, we will provide a concrete, shared experience for the team. This will allow them to witness the workflow, evaluate the quality of AI-generated outputs, and see the potential for increased development velocity firsthand, replacing abstract claims with a compelling, internally-built example.
