# 7. Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

*   **Overall PRD Completeness:** 95%
*   **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
*   **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready
*   **Most Critical Gaps or Concerns:** The PRD is very strong. The only minor gap is the lack of explicit definition for some cross-functional requirements like data retention or detailed operational monitoring, which are acceptable to defer for an internal showcase project of this nature.

| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None                                                                                                        |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data retention and detailed operational monitoring are not explicitly defined. This is acceptable for the MVP. |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None                                                                                                        |

## Top Issues by Priority

*   **BLOCKERS:** None.
*   **HIGH:** None.
*   **MEDIUM:** None.
*   **LOW:** Consider adding a note about data retention policies (e.g., "Data is for demo purposes only and can be wiped at any time") and operational monitoring (e.g., "Basic container-level monitoring is sufficient for the showcase") to fully close the gaps in the Cross-Functional Requirements section. This is not essential for the MVP.

## MVP Scope Assessment

The MVP scope is well-defined, minimal, and directly aligned with the project's goals. The stories are appropriately sized and logically sequenced. The scope is realistic for a rapid development cycle.

## Technical Readiness

The technical constraints and guidance are exceptionally clear, specific, and ready for the Architect. The technical risks have been identified and acknowledged.

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT:** The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.
