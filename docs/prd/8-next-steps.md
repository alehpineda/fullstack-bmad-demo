# 8. Next Steps

This document is now complete and ready for handoff.

## 8.1. UX Expert Prompt

> Hello Sally, please review the attached PRD (`docs/prd.md`), specifically the 'User Interface Design Goals' section. The Architect will be creating a technical plan, and your role is to ensure their plan for the frontend aligns with the established UX vision. No new design work is needed at this stage; your role is purely advisory.

## 8.2. Architect Prompt

> Hello Winston, your task is to create the full system architecture for the project defined in the attached Product Requirements Document (`docs/prd.md`). Please read the document carefully, paying close attention to the 'Technical Assumptions' and the detailed stories in Epic 1. Your architecture document should provide a clear, actionable blueprint for the Developer agent to begin implementation.
