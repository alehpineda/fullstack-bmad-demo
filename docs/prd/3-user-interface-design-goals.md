# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## 3.1. Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be minimalist and utility-focused. The feel should be that of a technical demonstration tool: professional, uncluttered, and direct. **Visual flair should be actively avoided** in favor of a design that highlights the speed and accuracy of the data being presented.

## 3.2. Key Interaction Paradigms
The core interaction is a **Search-Request-Response** loop. The UI must provide immediate visual feedback for three key states:
1.  **Idle:** The initial state before a search.
2.  **Loading:** A brief state (e.g., a spinner) shown immediately after the user initiates a search, making it clear that a backend request is in progress.
3.  **Result:** The final state, displaying either the Pokémon data or a "not found" message.

## 3.3. Core Screens and Views
For the MVP, there is only one essential screen:
*   **Main Search Page:** A single view containing a text input for the Pokémon ID, a "Search" button, and a result display area. The result area should be empty by default.

## 3.4. Accessibility: Basic Best Practices
While no formal accessibility standard (e.g., WCAG) is required for this internal MVP, the implementation **must adhere to basic best practices**. This includes using semantic HTML, ensuring the search input and button are keyboard-navigable, and maintaining sufficient color contrast for readability.

## 3.5. Branding
There are no specific branding requirements. The visual style should be neutral, clean, and professional. It can take subtle inspiration from the classic Pokedex color scheme (e.g., red, white) but must remain generic and not use any copyrighted assets or logos.

## 3.6. Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application must be a responsive web application, functional and usable on modern desktop and mobile browsers.
