## 10. Testing Strategy

To mitigate risks and ensure high quality, the following testing strategies will be implemented in addition to the standard unit and integration tests.

#### 10.1. Data Ingestion Contract Testing

The data ingestion script's dependency on the external PokeAPI will be managed via contract testing.
*   **Mock Data:** A sample of the PokeAPI JSON responses will be captured and stored locally within the `backend/tests/` directory.
*   **CI Reliability:** The test suite will run the ingestion logic against these local, static JSON files. This decouples the CI pipeline from the external service, ensuring fast and reliable test execution.
*   **Negative Testing:** Tests will include malformed mock data (e.g., missing fields, incorrect types) to validate the script's error handling and data validation robustness.

#### 10.2. HTML Fragment Validation

To address the tight coupling between the backend and the HTMX-powered frontend, tests for HTML-generating endpoints will be created.
*   **Tooling:** The `pytest` suite will use a library like `BeautifulSoup` to parse and inspect the HTML strings returned by the `/web/pokemon/search` endpoint.
*   **Assertions:** Tests will assert the structural integrity of the HTML fragments, verifying the presence of key elements, IDs, and classes (e.g., `div#pokemon-display`, `h2` tag with correct text, `img` tag with correct `src`).
