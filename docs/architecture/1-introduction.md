## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the system architecture for the Pokedex application, a project designed to serve as a tangible case study for the BMAD (Build-Measure-Adapt-Document) development method. It provides a comprehensive blueprint for developers, covering the high-level design, technology stack, API specifications, and operational considerations.

The primary goal of this architecture is to fulfill the requirements outlined in the [Product Requirements Document (PRD)](./prd.md) while adhering to the principles of simplicity, maintainability, and rapid development.
