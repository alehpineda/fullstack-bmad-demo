# Pokedex Fullstack BMAD Method Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### 1.1. Goals

*   Secure a "go" decision from team leadership to pilot the BMAD method on a future, real-world project.
*   Create a definitive, reusable training asset for onboarding team members to AI-assisted development practices.
*   Measurably increase the team's confidence and reduce skepticism about adopting AI-driven development workflows.
*   Demonstrate a significantly faster development time for the MVP compared to traditional methods.
*   Ensure AI-generated code and documentation are rated as high-quality and maintainable by the team.
*   Deliver a fully functional and deployed Pokedex application via Docker.
*   Allow a user to successfully search for a Pokémon by its ID and see the correct name and sprite displayed.

### 1.2. Background Context

The primary challenge this project addresses is the difficulty for our internal teams to fully grasp the practical benefits of the BMAD method from abstract documentation alone. This creates skepticism and slows the adoption of new AI-assisted development paradigms.

This project will serve as a tangible, end-to-end case study to overcome this hesitancy. By building a Pokedex application from scratch using the BMAD method, we will provide a concrete, shared experience for the team. This will allow them to witness the workflow, evaluate the quality of AI-generated outputs, and see the potential for increased development velocity firsthand, replacing abstract claims with a compelling, internally-built example.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Functional

*   **FR1:** The backend shall provide an API endpoint to fetch a single Pokémon's data (ID, name, sprite URL) from the database using its unique ID.
*   **FR2:** A data synchronization script shall populate the local SQLite database with data for the **first 151 Pokémon** (ID, name, and sprite URL) from the public Pokémon API.
*   **FR3:** The frontend shall display a single page containing a search input field that accepts a Pokémon ID.
*   **FR4:** Upon entering a valid Pokémon ID and initiating a search, the frontend shall display the corresponding Pokémon's ID, name, and sprite image.
*   **FR5:** If a search is initiated for a Pokémon ID that does not exist in the database, the frontend shall display a clear "Pokémon not found" message.

### 2.2. Non-Functional

*   **NFR1:** The application must be a responsive web application, accessible on modern desktop and mobile browsers.
*   **NFR2:** API response times for fetching Pokémon data should be under 200ms for a responsive user experience.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

### 3.1. Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be minimalist and utility-focused. The feel should be that of a technical demonstration tool: professional, uncluttered, and direct. **Visual flair should be actively avoided** in favor of a design that highlights the speed and accuracy of the data being presented.

### 3.2. Key Interaction Paradigms
The core interaction is a **Search-Request-Response** loop. The UI must provide immediate visual feedback for three key states:
1.  **Idle:** The initial state before a search.
2.  **Loading:** A brief state (e.g., a spinner) shown immediately after the user initiates a search, making it clear that a backend request is in progress.
3.  **Result:** The final state, displaying either the Pokémon data or a "not found" message.

### 3.3. Core Screens and Views
For the MVP, there is only one essential screen:
*   **Main Search Page:** A single view containing a text input for the Pokémon ID, a "Search" button, and a result display area. The result area should be empty by default.

### 3.4. Accessibility: Basic Best Practices
While no formal accessibility standard (e.g., WCAG) is required for this internal MVP, the implementation **must adhere to basic best practices**. This includes using semantic HTML, ensuring the search input and button are keyboard-navigable, and maintaining sufficient color contrast for readability.

### 3.5. Branding
There are no specific branding requirements. The visual style should be neutral, clean, and professional. It can take subtle inspiration from the classic Pokedex color scheme (e.g., red, white) but must remain generic and not use any copyrighted assets or logos.

### 3.6. Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application must be a responsive web application, functional and usable on modern desktop and mobile browsers.

## 4. Technical Assumptions

### 4.1. Repository Structure: Monorepo
The project will be developed within a single monorepo. This structure is mandated to simplify project setup, dependency management, and the overall development workflow for this self-contained showcase.

### 4.2. Service Architecture
The application will be built as a simple, self-contained monolith. It will follow a classic 3-tier architecture (Frontend -> Backend API -> Database) to ensure the design is easy to understand, fast to develop, and straightforward to demonstrate.

### 4.3. Testing Requirements
A baseline of automated testing is required to validate the quality and correctness of the AI-generated code.
*   **Scope:** The testing suite must include **Unit Tests** for key logic and **Integration Tests** for the API endpoint.
*   **Enforcement:** These automated tests **must be integrated into the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** and configured to run automatically on every pull request as a mandatory status check before merging.

### 4.4. Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
The following technology stack is mandated by the Project Brief to meet the specific goals of the showcase:
*   **Backend (Python & FastAPI):** Chosen for its development speed, modern features, and automatic documentation generation, which aligns with the goal of showcasing a rapid, well-documented process.
*   **Frontend (HTMX & Tailwind CSS):** Chosen to demonstrate a modern, lightweight approach to frontend development that avoids heavy JavaScript frameworks, reinforcing the theme of speed and simplicity.
*   **Database (SQLite):** Chosen for its zero-configuration, file-based nature, making the project entirely self-contained and easy to run for demonstration purposes.
*   **Infrastructure (Docker):** The entire application must be containerized to ensure a consistent, one-command startup experience for the showcase.
*   **Development Workflow (GitHub Issues & Copilot Agent):** This is a core, non-negotiable component. The process of converting stories to issues that are then implemented by the Copilot agent is a primary element to be demonstrated.

## 5. Epic List

*   **Epic 1: Core MVP - Search by ID**
    *   **Goal:** Deliver a fully functional, containerized Pokedex application that proves the end-to-end BMAD workflow by allowing a user to fetch and view a Pokémon by its ID. This epic includes all foundational work (repo setup, data population, CI/CD) necessary to deliver the working MVP.

*   **Epic 2: Iteration - Enhanced Features**
    *   **Goal:** Demonstrate the iterative power of the BMAD method by seamlessly extending the application with key user-centric features, including search-by-name, expanded data displays (stats, types), and arrow-based navigation.

## 6. Epic 1 Details: Core MVP - Search by ID

#### Story 1.1: Python Project Scaffolding
*   **As a developer,** I want the Python backend project to be scaffolded with `uv` for environment management and `ruff` and `pytest` for quality tooling, **so that** I have a modern, standardized foundation for development.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The `backend` directory is configured as a `uv` project.
    2.  A `pyproject.toml` file in the `backend` directory is configured with the initial project dependencies: `fastapi` and `uvicorn`.
    3.  The `pyproject.toml` also includes development dependencies: `pytest` for testing and `ruff` for linting.
    4.  A `uv` virtual environment can be successfully created and activated from within the `backend` directory.
    5.  The existing `.gitignore` file is updated to exclude the `.venv` directory.

#### Story 1.2: Async Pokémon Data Ingestion
*   **As a developer,** I want an efficient, asynchronous script that uses `httpx` to fetch detailed data for the first 151 Pokémon and batch-inserts it into the database, **so that** the data ingestion process is fast and robust.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The data population script uses the `httpx` library to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the PokeAPI.
    2.  The script leverages `asyncio` to run the API calls for all 151 Pokémon concurrently.
    3.  The script uses the defined SQLAlchemy models to prepare the data for the database.
    4.  After processing the API responses, the script inserts the new records into the database in batches to ensure efficient writes.
    5.  The script is idempotent: if run again, it will not create duplicate Pokémon entries or raise an error.
    6.  The final `pokedex.db` file is correctly created and populated with the data for the first 151 Pokémon.

#### Story 1.3: Backend API Endpoint
*   **As a frontend developer,** I want a backend API endpoint that returns a single Pokémon's data in JSON format when I provide its ID, **so that** I can display that data in the user interface.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A FastAPI application provides a GET endpoint at `/api/pokemon/{pokemon_id}`.
    2.  When a valid ID is provided (e.g., `/api/pokemon/25`), the endpoint returns a `200 OK` status with a JSON body containing the `id`, `name`, and `sprite_url`.
    3.  When an invalid or non-existent ID is provided (e.g., `/api/pokemon/999`), the endpoint returns a `404 Not Found` status.
    4.  The endpoint is covered by automated unit and integration tests using `pytest`.

#### Story 1.4: Search UI and Result Display
*   **As a user,** I want a simple web page where I can enter a Pokémon's ID and see its name and image, **so that** I can find information about a specific Pokémon.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The page displays a text input for the Pokémon ID and a "Search" button.
    2.  Initiating a search triggers a call to the `/api/pokemon/{pokemon_id}` backend endpoint.
    3.  While the data is being fetched, a loading indicator is displayed for a minimum of 300ms.
    4.  If the API returns a Pokémon, its ID, name, and sprite image are displayed.
    5.  If the API returns a 404 error, a "Pokémon not found" message is displayed.
    6.  The UI is responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile viewports.

#### Story 1.5: Production-Ready Containerization and CI
*   **As a developer,** I want the application containerized using optimized, production-ready images and have a CI pipeline, **so that** I can ensure a consistent, reliable, and efficient build and test process.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates the application services.
    2.  The backend service is built using a `python-slim` base image.
    3.  The frontend service uses a standard `nginx` base image to serve the static HTML content.
    4.  Running `docker compose up` successfully builds and starts the `nginx` and `python-slim` services.
    5.  The application is fully functional, with the Nginx container correctly proxying requests to the Python backend service.
    6.  A GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run `ruff` for linting and `pytest` for tests on every pull request.
    7.  The pull request in GitHub shows a "pass" or "fail" status from the CI check.

### Top Issues by Priority

*   **BLOCKERS:** None.
*   **HIGH:** None.
*   **MEDIUM:** None.
*   **LOW:** Consider adding a note about data retention policies (e.g., "Data is for demo purposes only and can be wiped at any time") and operational monitoring (e.g., "Basic container-level monitoring is sufficient for the showcase") to fully close the gaps in the Cross-Functional Requirements section. This is not essential for the MVP.

### MVP Scope Assessment

The MVP scope is well-defined, minimal, and directly aligned with the project's goals. The stories are appropriately sized and logically sequenced. The scope is realistic for a rapid development cycle.

### Technical Readiness

The technical constraints and guidance are exceptionally clear, specific, and ready for the Architect. The technical risks have been identified and acknowledged.

### Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT:** The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.
